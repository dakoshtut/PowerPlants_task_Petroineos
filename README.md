# Power Plants task for Petroineos

Hello, my name is Danial. Thank you for taking the time to consider my submission.
The solution to the PowerPlants assignment is located in the `solution_notebook.ipynb`. 

## Notes on Implementation

- **Missing Data:**  
  Since the instructions did not explicitly state how to handle missing rows, I chose to remove only those rows for which _all_ columns were empty. As a result, you may still see some `NaT` values for individual fields where partial data was unavailable.

Thank you again for your time.

Best regards,  
Danial Kusmanov
